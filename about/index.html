<h1 class="page-title"> About Me </h1>
<div class="grid-10">
    <p> My name is Lyndsey and I'm a Software Developer. I develop using C#, JavaScript/jQuery and HTML/CSS/SCSS. </p>

    <p> Over the last few years I've taken a great interest in JavaScript. I've had a peek at where the industry is headed and I'm loving it. </p>

    <p> Most of my free time is spent learning as much JavaScript as I can; I enjoy coming up with project ideas that will enhance my skillset. </p>

    <p> When I'm not learning, I enjoy playing mobile word games. </p>

    <p> I've been a fan of word games for over 14 years and I'm quite the competitive player, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjC3Vbgva8k" target="_blank"> see me in action! </a></p>

      <p> The majority of the Blocks codebase is vanilla JavaScript, with some jQuery added in for AJAX calls. I use a small bit of PHP to submit scores and display the leaderboard. </p>
