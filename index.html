        <p> My name is Lyndsey and I'm a Software Developer. I've worked as a front-end and back-end developer for around 5 years, from Classic ASP, to PHP and most recently C#. </p>

        <p> The last few years my interests have changed from loving the full-stack to wanting to solely focus on the front-end, in particular JavaScript. I've had a peek at where the industry is going and I'm loving it! </p>

        <p> Most of my free time is spent learning as much JavaScript as I can; I enjoy coming up with ideas for projects in order to enhance my skillset and become familiarised with the subject, whether it's a new library or just the language in general. </p>

        <p> When I'm not learning, I enjoy spending time with those closest to me and playing mobile word games like Ruzzle and Scramble with Friends </p>

        <p> I've been a fan of word games for over 14 years and I'm quite a competitive player, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjC3Vbgva8k" target="_blank"> see me in action! </a></p>
