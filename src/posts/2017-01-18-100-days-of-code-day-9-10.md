Current Project: [wordapi.net](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net).

I changed the repository name (again!). I bought a domain to house the project once it's completed so renamed to match the domain name, for consistency.

I'm in the process of building a word API using NodeJs and Express that will allow users to retrieve word lists based on parameters such as length and suffix, solve anagrams, generate string permutations and solve boggle-style matrices.

The API currrently holds words found in the [SOWPODS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Scrabble_Words) dictionary, approximately 270,000 words.

Progress so far has been good. I've created two end points, one that checks word validity and another that filters words based on length, prefix and suffix.

Please refer to my previous #100DaysOfCode posts for more information about my
progress so far, with code examples.

On day 8, I [posted](http://lyndseyb.co.uk/posts/100-days-of-code-day-8) about performance testing Trie prefix searching vs Array prefix searching. The [Trie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) method was much more performant.

On day 9, I tested the same but for suffix searching. Please see an example of both methods below:

**Array Search**

```javascript
function filterBySuffix(suffix, word) {
    const wordLen = word.length;
    const wordSuffix = word.substring(wordLen - suffix.length, wordLen);

    return wordSuffix === suffix.toUpperCase();
}

let wordList = _dictionary;
if (req.query.suffix) {
    wordList = wordList.filter(filterBySuffix.bind(null, suffix));
}
```

**Trie Search**

```javascript
function recurseSuffix(suffix, node, wordList = [], word = "") {
    for (const n in node) {
        if (n === "$" && word.slice(-suffix.length) === suffix) {
            wordList.push(word.toUpperCase());
        } else {
            recurseSuffix(suffix, node[n], wordList, word + n);
        }
    }

    return wordList;
}
```

The Array search uses the [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method to filter out words that don't contain the passed in suffix.

The Trie search on the other hand has to recurse every node to its end in order to determine if the current word has the passed in prefix.

Searching the Array in this instance was faster than recursing the Trie.

In order to increase performance further, I replaced ES5's '''Array.filter()''' method with a standard '''for''' loop. This saw speeds increase even further:

```javascript
filterBySuffix(suffix, dictionary = _dictionary) {
  const wordList = [];
  const suffixLen = suffix.length;

  suffix = suffix.toUpperCase();

  for (let i = 0, len = dictionary.length; i < len; i++) {
    const word = dictionary[i];
    const wordLen = word.length;
    const wordSuffix = word.substring(wordLen - suffixLen, wordLen);

    if(wordSuffix !== suffix) {
      continue;
    }
    wordList.push(word);
  }
  return wordList;
}
```

Whilst the above method works and performs quite well, I'm still interested in seeing if the Trie can perform at a similar level for suffix searches. So my aim is to try a different approach and run some further tests.

On to day 10. Today wasn't as code heavy. I realised that I'd been working through this project without any testing or linting in place. Better to start now than later even if now is too late! I did some reading around esLint and found these resources to be extremely helpful:

-   [http://eslint.org](http://eslint.org)
-   [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

I used these guides to start creating my own rules, customised to my style of development. Here's what I have so far:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    rules: {
        quotes: [2, "single"],
        "no-var": 2,
        "prefer-const": 2,
        "no-empty-function": 2,
        // prefer === vs ==
        eqeqeq: 2,
        // no const reassignment
        "no-const-assign": 2,
        // use variables within the scope they are defined
        "block-scoped-var": 2,
        // disallow else after a return statement in if block
        "no-else-return": 2,
        // no unnecessary bind() methods
        "no-extra-bind": 2,
        // no switch fall-through
        "no-fallthrough": 2,
        // no function declarations inside loop
        "no-loop-func": 2,
        // prefer {} vs new Object();
        "no-new-object": 2,
        // prefer object() shorthand function declarations
        "object-shorthand": 2,
        // quotes around property names only when needed & for reserved words
        "quote-props": [2, "as-needed", { keywords: true }],
        // prefer [] vs new Array()
        "no-array-constructor": 2,
        // always return from array method callbacks
        "array-callback-return": 2,
        // prefer template strings vs concatenation
        "prefer-template": 2,
        // prefer ${name} vs ${ name }
        "template-curly-spacing": 2,
    },
};
```

Tomorrow I plan on continuing with my esLint configuration and hopefully get some integration tests set up for the API to test all of the possible routes.
