Current Project: [wordapi.net](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net).

I finalised my EsLint configuration today and fixed the little bits of code that threw an error due to some newly added rules. You can see the full configuration file here: [https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net/blob/master/eslint/rules.js](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net/blob/master/eslint/rules.js).

I then started looking at [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for testing my express server. I found a few articles which were really useful:

-   [codeforgeek.com](https://codeforgeek.com/2015/07/unit-testing-nodejs-application-using-mocha/)
-   [codementor.io](https://www.codementor.io/nodejs/tutorial/testing-express-apis-with-supertest)
-   [willi.am](http://willi.am/blog/2014/07/28/test-your-api-with-supertest/)

My aim is to get Supertest up and running and validating all API end-points.

Following that, I am going to look at additional frameworks for unit testing. I'd spent a little while researching testing frameworks today but it was all a bit overwhelming. I saw lots of different keywords like `Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Supertest, Buster, Jest, Expresso...` Which one should I choose?

Before I choose a unit testing framework, I'm going to look at each in turn and determine which is the best tool for the job.
