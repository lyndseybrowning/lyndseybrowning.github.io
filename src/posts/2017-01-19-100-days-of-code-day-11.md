Current Project: [wordapi.net](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net).

I didn't get much coding done on day 11. I continued setting up my [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) configuration, using AirBnB's awesome JavaScript [guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

As I added new rules, I went through my existing code-base to fix up some of the issues. I was happy that the number of errors were quite small; most were related to variable reassignment (which I'm trying to avoid) and using `let` when I should use `const`.

My configuration is now as follows:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    rules: {
        // always return from array method callbacks
        "array-callback-return": 2,
        // require () around arrow function with more than one argument
        "arrow-parens": [2, "as-needed"],
        // use variables within the scope they are defined
        "block-scoped-var": 2,
        // prefer === vs ==
        eqeqeq: 2,
        // use named function expressions instead of function declarations
        "func-style": 2,
        // prefer [] vs new Array()
        "no-array-constructor": 2,
        // no const reassignment
        "no-const-assign": 2,
        // disallow else after a return statement in if block
        "no-else-return": 2,
        // as it says
        "no-empty-function": 2,
        // no unnecessary bind() methods
        "no-extra-bind": 2,
        // no switch fall-through
        "no-fallthrough": 2,
        // no function declarations inside loop
        "no-loop-func": 2,
        // prefer {} vs new Object();
        "no-new-object": 2,
        // never use function constructor e.g. new Function()
        "no-new-func": 2,
        // never reassign parameters
        "no-param-reassign": 2,
        "no-var": 2,
        // prefer object() shorthand function declarations
        "object-shorthand": 2,
        "prefer-arrow-callback": 2,
        "prefer-const": 2,
        // prefer rest params vs arguments object
        "prefer-rest-params": 2,
        // prefer template strings vs concatenation
        "prefer-template": 2,
        quotes: [2, "single"],
        // quotes around property names only when needed & for reserved words
        "quote-props": [2, "as-needed", { keywords: true }],
        // prefer ${name} vs ${ name }
        "template-curly-spacing": 2,
    },
};
```

I decided to create my rules in a JavaScript file so that I could create comments for each rule. I'll remove the comments when I'm comfortable with them enough to know what they mean at a glance.

The rules are imported into my `.eslintrc` file using the `extends` keyword, which accepts a path to a JavaScript file:

```json
{
    "env": {
        "node": 1
    },
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": 2017,
        "sourceType": "module",
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "impliedStrict": 1,
            "experimentalObjectRestSpread": true
        }
    },
    "extends": "./eslint/rules.js"
}
```

I'm going to continue with ESLint configuration before moving on to setting up integration testing. I realise I should have started this sooner so I need to get in place now before it's too late.
