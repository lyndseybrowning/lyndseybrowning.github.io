Current Project: [wordapi.net](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net).

On Day 15, I wrote some of my first **passing** tests.

I'm using [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to test the API. Supertest is a library for testing node.js HTTP servers. You pass an instance of your server to the Supertest library which then simulates the requests for you. Here's an example:

```javascript
import request from "supertest";
import express from "express";

// create server, or import an existing server set up
const app = express();

// simulate request
request(app)
    .get("/api/some/url")
    .expect(200)
    .end((err, res) => {
        if (err) {
            throw err;
        }

        console.log(res); // this is the result returned from /api/some/url
    });
```

To test the results returned from the API, I'm using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/). (**Note:** Supertest works with any test framework). Mocha is the test framework itself and Chai is the assertion library that allows us to express our tests in a readable, expressive style.

To begin creating tests, simply create a `test` directory in the route of the project and add a new javascript file corresponding to the nature of the test. Here is an example:

```javascript
// I'm importing chai.expect() but other options are available
// such as should and assert
import { expect } from "chai";

function sumTwoNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// describe and it are part of Mocha's test framework
describe("Sum Numbers", () => {
    it("should sum two numbers correctly", () => {
        const sum = sumTwoNumbers(1, 2);
        // expect is the assertion library
        expect(sum).to.equal(3);
    });
});
```

To run the test, we need to create a script in our `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "NODE_ENV=test mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register"
}
```

The `js:babel-core/register` tells Mocha to compile ES6 (as it compiles ES5 by default).

When we run `npm test`, all test files in the test directory are run automatically and from the example above, we should see the output:

```
Sum Numbers
✓ should sum two numbers correctly
```

A failing test will force an error in the console.

The first test I made for my API was to test the word validity end point: `/api/valid/:word`. I decided that I would need the following tests:

-   A 404 status should be returned when no word is passed
-   The result returned should be in JSON format
-   A successful call should return the passed in word in lowercase
-   The API should return `false`when an invalid word is passed
-   The API should return `true` when a valid word is passed

Since all tests are related to the same API end point, I grouped them all in one `describe()` block:

```javascript
describe("GET /api/valid/:word", () => {
    it("should return a 404 status when no word is passed");
    it("responds with json");
    it("should convert the word to lowercase");
    it("returns false when an invalid word is requested");
    it("returns false when an valid word is requested");
});
```

The first test was the simplest, a check for a 404 status code:

```javascript
request(app).get("/api/valid").expect(404, done);
```

`done` is passed as a callback from the `it()` function.

To check for a JSON formatted result, I had to check the `Content-Type`:

```javascript
request(app)
    .get("/api/valid/car")
    .expect("Content-Type", /json/)
    .expect(200, done);
```

Once I'd successfully created the first two tests, the rest came a lot more easily:

```javascript
it("should convert the word to lowercase", (done) => {
    // create a word with one or more uppercase characters
    const word = "EXPERIMENT";

    request(app)
        .get(`/api/valid/${word}`)
        .end((err, res) => {
            if (err) {
                return done(err);
            }
            // res.body is the data returned from the API
            // e.g. { word: 'experiment', valid: true }
            expect(res.body.word).to.equal(word.toLowerCase());
            done();
        });
});

it("returns false when an invalid word is requested", (done) => {
    // create a random word that I know is invalid
    const invalidWord = "randomdummyword";

    request(app)
        .get(`/api/valid/${invalidWord}`)
        .end((err, res) => {
            if (err) {
                return done(err);
            }

            // deep equal checks that the object returned in res.body
            // matches the object passed to the equal() method
            expect(res.body).to.deep.equal({
                word: invalidWord,
                valid: false,
            });
            done();
        });
});

it("returns true when a valid word is requested", (done) => {
    const validWord = "antidisestablishmentarianism";

    request(app)
        .get(`/api/valid/${validWord}`)
        .end((err, res) => {
            if (err) {
                return done(err);
            }

            expect(res.body).to.deep.equal({
                word: validWord,
                valid: true,
            });
            done();
        });
});
```

Running `npm test` gave me the following output:

```
GET /api/valid/:word
    ✓ should return a 404 status when no word is passed
    ✓ responds with json
    ✓ should convert the word to lowercase
    ✓ returns false when an invalid word is requested
    ✓ returns true when a valid word is requested

  5 passing (53ms)
```

On day 16, I'm going to continue adding more API tests to handle the list route that fetches words based on length, prefix and suffix.
