        I work for a small company in the Welsh valleys called Riskmonitor. We provide software for managing statutory compliance as well as HR management and coaching software. Some of the technologies I use on a daily basis:

        <li> SQL / SQL Server </li>
        <li> SVN </li>
        <li> JavaScript and jQuery </li>
        <li> AJAX </li>
        <li> HTML/CSS </li>
      </ul>

      <p> I have had the pleasure of working with a wide range of subjects whilst at Riskmonitor, occasionally having to create software from conception to completion. Some of my works include: </p>
