Current Project: [wordapi.net](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net).

I decided that I wanted my tests to automatically run every time I changed a test file. I could do this using the watch flag inside my package.json file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "NODE_ENV=test mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register -w"
}
```

However, each time I changed a file, I was receiving the following error:

```
1)  Uncaught error outside test suite:
    Uncaught Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::8080
```

A little bit of [reading](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32868692/mocha-watching-fails-under-npm) later led me to understand that I was starting my app twice, once from under the tests and another in my actual app.

To fix this error, I simply needed to do the following in my ```server.js``` file:

```javascript
if(!module.parent) {
  app.server.listen(port);
}
```

Click [here](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net/blob/master/src/server.js) for the full file.

So now I can write my tests and have them update as I make changes. Saves me having to ```npm test``` each time I add/update tests.
